# Machine Learning and Data Science projects


In this repository, you will find small machine learning and data science projects which are mostly done using Scikit-Learn. All resources, datasets, are avaiable on Kaggle and Scikit-Learn documentation. Links are given.


Importance of this notebook:

    * Helps solve common machine learning and data science problems
    * Has common examples of many models of Scikit-Learn
    * Contains solutions for many problems which can later be used for other problems
    * Is good practice and has resources and useful datasets used for learning Machine Learning basic problems
    * Revision of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Matplotlib (along with Seaborn)
